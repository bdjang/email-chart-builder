## Project Background

The first objective of this project is to enable email marketers and developers to create clear, colorful visuals and bar charts that are mobile responsive, dark mode compatible, and accessible to screen readers quickly and efficiently. The second objective is to reimagine and change how data graphics are displayed in email templates and newsletters.

Each of the 20+ bar charts have been built using `<table>` elements and CSS styling specifically for email templates. All coding required for creating individual data bars with customized widths, label text, colors, and more have been taken care of with vanilla JavaScript.
